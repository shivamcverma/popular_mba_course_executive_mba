            "answer": "Here is the difference between an Executive MBA and a Part-time MB Executive MBA : Executive MBA programs are typically designed for working professionals. An executive MBA program is a lot like a regular MBA program. The main difference is that an executive MBA program is primarily designed to educate working executives, managers, entrepreneurs, and other business leaders. After earning an executive MBA, you could continue to work in your current position. You may be able to accept more responsibility or pursue promotion opportunities. Part Time MBA : Generally the classes for part-time MBA are scheduled after the normal business hours. That makes easy for the working professionals to attend it and study. Part-time MBA program degree fees is much lesser than full-time MBA, thus causes lesser financial strain. Here the students have the advantage to apply what they learn to their immediate job.

            "answer": "An eMBA is a PG programme just like an offline or online master's degree. But there are some differences between the two in terms of eligibility.  For an executive MBA online course, you will need to have 10+ years of working experience, specially when you are pursuing it from the world's top institutes like Wharton or IIMs. And for master's, like an online MA , the eligibility is just a bachelor's, ideally an online BA . Work experience is not really required for pursuing a master's degree programme, whether offline or online. Hope this helps!!! Not satisfied with answer? Ask Shiksha GPT"
